/*
 * Deterministic Math for shared/: the same bits on every CPU, OS and JS engine.
 * A port of V8's src/base/ieee754.cc (fdlibm) and its Torque Math.hypot, using only + - * /, Math.sqrt and exact bit
 * moves, which IEEE 754 fixes everywhere. Built-ins differ by an ulp between engines and between compilers (V8 on
 * arm64 is built with fused multiply-add), which split the headless match between Macs and Linux (RAY-152).
