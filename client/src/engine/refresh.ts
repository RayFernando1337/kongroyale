// RefreshEstimate holds an uneven reading under the highest steady one on the screen, since Safari's timestamps under
// an uneven load carry a fast tail that is no period at all.

/** Percentile of the intervals read as the period. A frame that misses vsync is presented one or more whole periods
 *  later, never earlier, so the fast tail of the rAF intervals is the period itself however slow the game runs on
 *  average. The 20th percentile used before read a GPU-bound 21 fps match on a 60 Hz screen as 30 Hz (RAY-186). At 5 %,
 *  at least 5 of every 90 frames must make vsync; fewer read as a fraction of the refresh, as no frame making it does. */

 *  when the rendering update started, not the vsync: idle they spread about ±3 ms (a 13-15 ms fast tail on a 60 Hz
 *  screen, which read 67-77 Hz), and under an uneven load an update that starts late is followed by one a few ms after
 *  the next vsync, so the fast tail read 100-144 Hz on a 60 Hz screen (RAY-186, the guard's A/B). Each callback takes
