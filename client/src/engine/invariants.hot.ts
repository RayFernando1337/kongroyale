// "A location is never invisible": the per-frame scan behind ?invariants (engine/invariants.ts installs it after the
// cull update, right before the draw, so it reads exactly the state that renders). A POI is drawn by its built model, a
// far impostor (?farimp) or an HLOD proxy (engine/hlod.ts). Each counts with what is left of it after the cull's fades
// and reveals and the dither's dissolve (engine/cull.ts, engine/dither.ts); the model counts with its most opaque drawn
// mesh that writes colour, and each piece counts only when it is on the camera's layers and in its frustum, as the
// renderer culls it. The POI's coverage is their sum, capped at 1: a hand-over dissolves one out with the complementary mask of the
// one dissolving in, so the two cover min(1, a + b) of its pixels. Once a POI has been drawn at w.floor or more, it must
// stay there for as long as it is in view and has something to draw it with. RAY-148 (the impostor hid as the model's
// dissolve began) and RAY-178 were found by people watching GPU screenshots; this makes that class of hand-over gap a
// check a software renderer can run. A POI the terrain occludes (engine/occlusion.ts) is not checked; one with nothing
// to draw it (lowmem without ?farimp, before its build) starts over. Allocates nothing.
