// Client-side match mirror: clock sync, local prediction + reconciliation, remote interpolation with an adaptive
// buffer, loot/chest state, and event decoding. Rendering lives in render.ts; this file has no three.js in it.
//
// Netcode contract:
// - PREDICTION: each 60 Hz tick the local player is stepped with a quantised input (bit-identical to what the server
//   decodes) and the result is stored per input seq. A snapshot carries the server's exact state after input `lastSeq`;
//   if it equals what we predicted for that seq nothing happens, otherwise we restore it and replay the unacked inputs.
// - REMOTES are drawn at a render clock driven by snapshot ARRIVALS (newest data - adaptive jitter buffer), never
//   extrapolated: when data runs out they hold the newest sample.
// - LAG COMPENSATION: every input carries the exact blend (snapshot ticks A, A+span, fraction f) of the last drawn frame;
//   the server rewinds to those same numbers with the same function (shared/sim/hitscan.ts). A shot that will reach the
//   server after its view fell out of the rewind window (MAX_REWIND_TICKS) is judged there against the pose at the cap,
//   so its predicted hit is re-traced against that pose and reported as a miss when it misses there (lateVerdict).
