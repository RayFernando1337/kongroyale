//   • no `pos`  → it's YOU (first-person: 2D, stereo, your own gun gets sub + mechanics + ducking)
//   • `pos`     → it's in the world (HRTF-panned, distance curves, occlusion, speed-of-sound delay, terrain echoes)
//   • loops need `loopId`; calling play() again with the same loopId UPDATES pos/volume/rate (no restart)

// shotgun / AR at ≤ 5 m — ≥ 1.5 dB under the master limiter's ceiling (measured at the limiter's gain-reduction tap).
// own (1P) levels are set for a HIERARCHY measured as 100 ms impulse loudness (I100) through the master: pistol ≈ -18,
// smg ≈ -17.5, ar ≈ -16.5, shotgun ≈ -14, rocket ≈ -13.5, sniper ≈ -12.5 — with ≤ 1 dB of master gain reduction on a single
// pistol / smg / ar shot.
// 3P: `hear` = level at 5 m; the loudness falls `a` dB per doubling to `knee` m, then `b` dB per doubling (the
// sniper and the AR carry furthest, a pistol barely leaves the block) — measured on a clear line it falls monotonically
// (≥ 2 dB per doubling) from 20 to 700 m. The near body crossfades (equal power, loudness-matched) into the gun's distant
// REPORT (its own spectral signature) and past ~350 m into the DIST report; the rolling
// far TAIL rises `rise` dB per doubling against the report beyond 120 m (the direct-to-tail ratio tells the range).

  // ---- SWIMMING: REAL
  // recordings only, untouched takes (cut, faded, level-matched; no EQ / compression / limiting), all mono, all on the
  // step reference (M -24). The strokes, the treading and the splashes are ONE pool session (kyles, freesound 6379xx);
  // the under-water sounds are hydrophone takes; the kong's breaths are unvoiced human breaths 2-3 semitones down.
  // Levels, as 100 ms impulse loudness (P) at the output before the bus trim: YOUR stroke -32 / sprint stroke -30.5 (≥ 6 dB
  // under your pistol's -24, ~9 dB over your own sprint step's -41), treading -37.5; SOMEONE ELSE's stroke at ≤ 3 m -26
  // (a sprint step: -26) on water:stroke's distance law: about a sprint step's level
  // at 35-40 m, muffled (not gone) behind a wall.
  //   swim:stroke       one pull on the surface; the take's loudness peak is 0.10-0.15 s in — fire at the hand entry. Takes
  //                     are 1.0-1.2 s (splash ≈ 0.5 s + drips): one pull every 0.8-0.9 s (gap 0.3 s: never a machine gun)
  //   swim:stroke-fast  a sprint-crawl pull, splashier: peak 0.06-0.10 s, one every 0.55-0.65 s
  //   swim:tread        idle sculling / lapping, no big splash: one every ~1.1 s (1.1 s takes, they overlap seamlessly)
  // UNDER WATER (local only, no pos): the mixer's under-water low-pass (uwLP, 20 kHz → 450 Hz, -6 dB) sits on p1 / p3 /
  // world / amb; the UI bus bypasses it (the hydrophone bed amb/underwater already plays there). Your own bubbles, strokes
  // and heartbeat are bone-conducted and right at your ears — they must not be smeared into the 450 Hz mud — so they ride
  // the UI bus (no reverb, never ducked) and carry the under-water colour themselves: hydrophone recordings. They sit
  // about level with the bed (bed: -32 LUFS-I, -28 M; strokes -30 M, bubbles -30.5 M) so they read over it.
  //   swim:uw-stroke    a stroke while under: the hydrophone whoosh swells to its peak 0.3-0.5 s after the trigger
  //   swim:bubbles      an exhale bubble burst rising past your ears (1.35 s): every few seconds under / when low on air
  //   swim:low-air      ONE heartbeat (lub at 0.02 s, dub at ~0.27 s) per call: fire every ~0.9 s while breath < 30 %
  //                     (~0.7 s near empty). Subtle: 4 dB under the strokes
  // THE TRANSITIONS: yours on the UI bus too (the take itself goes from air to water / water to air: the camera's muffle
  // ramp — 60 ms in, 150 ms out — would otherwise swallow the plunge / the break); others' on p3 from the air.
  //   swim:dive         yours: a nose breath in → the head under at 0.30 s → the ears under (a hydrophone's immersion) at
  //                     0.36 s → bubbles rushing past (1.5 s). Others hear the head-under splash (swim/dive-w)
  //   swim:surface      the break (peak 0.05-0.10 s) + water streaming off the fur + a blowing exhale from 0.08 s (1.6 s)
  //   (yours under water — strokes, bubbles, heartbeat, the dive / surfacing — ride the `near` bus: past the underwater
  //    muffle, on the Combat volume; mixer.ts)
  //   swim:gasp         a big desperate inhale. Fire it WITH swim:surface when surfacing low on air: it waits 0.45 s, so
  //                     the blow-out lands first, then the gasp
