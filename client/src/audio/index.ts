// KONG ROYALE audio engine — implements the GameAudio contract (./api.ts).
//
// Sample-based, layered, spatial. Every Sfx is an EventDef in ./bank.ts: round-robin variants + random pitch/gain so no
// two shots are identical; distance crossfades (body → tail → far report), speed-of-sound delay, air absorption,
// occlusion + echoes computed against the real heightfield and POI colliders (./world.ts), HRTF panning, a ducking
// mix bus with a glue compressor + look-ahead limiter (./mixer.ts), and biome ambience beds with directional surf
// (./ambience.ts).
//
//   const audio = createAudio();                    // starts fetching/decoding immediately (context suspended)
//   button.onclick = () => audio.unlock();          // resume on a user gesture (required by browsers)
//   audio.play("fire:ar");                          // YOUR gun (no pos → first person)
//   audio.play("fire:ar", { pos: [x, y, z] });       // someone else's gun
//   audio.play("chest:hum", { pos, loopId: "chest:17" }); audio.stopLoop("chest:17");
//   audio.play("heal:use", { dur: 5.5, item: "leaf-bundle", loopId: "use" }); audio.stopLoop("use") // cancel
//   each frame: audio.update(dt, { pos, fwd, up }, { biome, indoors, inStorm, altitude, storm: { x, z, r } });
//
// Real-time rules: one blast = one voice (burst merge), voice stealing by priority (your own sounds and the 4
// nearest shooters are never stolen; quiet far tails go first), echoes capped, every expensive world query cached and the
// listener-independent echo analysis done off the hot path (world.work() inside update()).
