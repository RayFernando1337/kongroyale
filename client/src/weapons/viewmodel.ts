// breathing, walk/sprint bob, look inertia, jump/land, per-weapon fire recoil, equip / holster, aim-down-sights for
// every gun, and per-weapon reload choreography where the left hand really carries what it loads:
//   mag     (SMG, AR)   hand grabs the mag, pulls it, lets it drop (a spinning copy falls away), fetches a fresh one from
//                       below the frame, seats it with a slap, back to the fore-end
//   pistol              thumb release → the mag falls out of the grip; the left hand brings a fresh one up into the
//                       grip, then racks the slide
//   shell   (shotgun)   one visible shell per sim shell-cycle: from below the frame to the loading port, thumbed in
//   bolt    (sniper)    the right hand lifts + pulls the bolt, the left presses two rounds into the open action, bolt home
//   warhead (rocket)    a fresh coconut warhead comes up in the left hand and slides onto the tube
// Reload timing is a pure function of u = elapsed / duration (the sim's reload time), so the audio foley keyframes
// (audio/bank.ts RELOAD_KEYS) line up with the same fractions — see RELOAD_KEYS_VM below.
//

// → gun (+ hands, parented in gun space). Zero allocation per frame.
