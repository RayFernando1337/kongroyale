// The front of a multi-process server (KR_PROCS > 1, HOSTING.md "One process per core"). A match runs on one core:
// every lobby's tick, its sockets and its WebTransport sessions share one process's main thread, so one process holds a
// few matches however many cores the machine has. The front forks KR_PROCS match processes (server/index.ts with
// KR_PROC set) and keeps the one public port. It serves the site itself (server/site.ts: the client, /health summed
// over the processes, bug reports, the admin area) and hands each game WebSocket, with the upgrade request it read and
// nothing more, to the process that owns it: ?p=N (a player's aux socket) to process N, ?room=CODE to the process the
// code belongs to (server/procs.ts procOf), anything else (a player who will create a room) to the process with the
// fewest players. Each process listens for WebTransport on its own UDP port, KR_WT_PORT + its index, and its "welcome"
// says which. The front counts every game WebSocket against KR_MAX_CONNS and KR_MAX_PER_IP across all processes; the
// admin's actions go to the process that holds the lobby. A process that exits is started again after a second.
