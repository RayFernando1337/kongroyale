------------------------------ MODULE DiagSend ------------------------------
(* KONG-71's player-side send flow, one tab, as built (client/src/playtest/report.ts, #215 and #233): SEND DIAGNOSTICS on
   the results card, REPORT A PROBLEM in the match menu, the crash card on the title, the send sheet (consent text,
   symptom chips, note, "Include my callsign"), and what the player sees after a send. The server accepts an upload
   or refuses it (POST /api/kongbot: rate limit, busy, too large); a send the server never answers is aborted after
   TIMEOUT_MS and shown as refused.

   RefusedShown = TRUE is the code; FALSE is the design as first written (a refused send went back without a word),
   kept for DiagSend.findings.cfg.

   The automatic summary (client/src/playtest/consent.ts, auto.ts, beat.ts summariesOn, the Settings row in
   ui/settings-model.ts) is on by default for every player of a production build and asks nothing: with no stored choice a
   summary may go. What makes that honest is the toast: nothing is sent before the small one-time toast on the title was
   shown (or the player chose in Settings), none after the player turned it off in Settings, and none while the browser's
   privacy signal (Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track) is on, which also keeps the toast from showing. A page under
   automation (navigator.webdriver) sends nothing and shows no toast unless the URL asked for diagnostics (?diag, or a
   VITE_KR_DIAG build), and the default stores no heartbeat record under the privacy signal. Not modelled: which event
   triggers a row, its rate limits and its size, and the production-build and ?diag=0 conditions (a page without them
   never starts the summaries, which is the same as a bot page with no flag). *)

  gpc,        \* the browser's privacy signal is on (Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track); fixed for the page

  bot,        \* the page runs under automation (navigator.webdriver); fixed for the page

(* the server answers (report.ts send). Accepted: "SENT, THANKS · <id>", and a send from the sheet stores the consent.
   A 200 JSON answer whose body the TIMEOUT_MS abort cut off is accepted too (without the id): the server only answers
   that way once the report is stored.
   Refused (a non-OK answer, no connection, or the TIMEOUT_MS abort): the sheet stays open with "Not sent: <why>", and
   a one-tap send shows a "NOT SENT" toast *)

(* the one-time toast (auto.ts showNotice): on the title once it is ready, never under the privacy signal, and it marks

(* the heartbeat's next write (beat.ts writeBeat, every 5 s and on pagehide or visibility): outside an explicit ?diag, with

(* --- the rules --- *)
\* Nothing a player sends by hand leaves the browser before they have seen the consent text on the sheet.
NoManualSendWithoutConsent == \A r \in sent : r.kind = "manual" => r.consented
\* The callsign goes only in a send where "Include my callsign" was ticked.
CallsignOnlyWhenTicked == \A r \in sent : r.callsign => r.ticked
\* An automatic summary leaves only after the toast was shown (or the player chose in Settings).
AutoOnlyAfterNotice == \A r \in sent : r.kind = "auto" => r.told
\* ... and never after the player turned it off in Settings or while the browser's privacy signal is on.
AutoRespectsOff == \A r \in sent : r.kind = "auto" => (~r.off /\ ~r.gpc)
\* A page under automation sends nothing unless the URL or build asked for diagnostics.
AutoNeverInAutomation == \A r \in sent : r.kind = "auto" => (~r.bot \/ r.flagged)
\* The default stores no heartbeat under the browser's privacy signal; only an explicit ?diag does.
NoBeatUnderSignal == beat => (flagged \/ ~gpc)
\* ... and a record that outlives a switch-off in Settings is deleted by the next write (within one 5 s beat), unless the player
\* switched back on first.
NoBeatAfterOff == (beat /\ ~flagged /\ autoSet = "off") ~> (~beat \/ autoSet /= "off")
\* Every send ends with something on screen: the thank-you with the report id, or a message that it did not go.
EverySendAnswered == [][screen = "sending" => screen' \in {"sent", "refused"}]_vars
\* ... and a send never hangs: the player always sees one of the two in the end.
