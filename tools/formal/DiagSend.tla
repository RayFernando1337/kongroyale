------------------------------ MODULE DiagSend ------------------------------
(* KONG-71's player-side send flow, one tab, as built (client/src/playtest/report.ts, #215 and #233): SEND DIAGNOSTICS on
   the results card, REPORT A PROBLEM in the match menu, the crash card on the title, the send sheet (consent text,
   symptom chips, note, "Include my callsign"), and what the player sees after a send. The server accepts an upload
   or refuses it (POST /api/kongbot: rate limit, busy, too large); a send the server never answers is aborted after
   TIMEOUT_MS and shown as refused.

   RefusedShown = TRUE is the code; FALSE is the design as first written (a refused send went back without a word),
   kept for DiagSend.findings.cfg. Not modelled: the automatic summary, which is not built (slice 2; when it is, add
   Auto, Settings and AutoOnlyWhenOn back as the plan had them, git show e1e3509:tools/formal/DiagSend.tla). *)

  /\ screen' = "sheet" /\ back' = IF screen = "crash" THEN "title" ELSE "menu"
  /\ UNCHANGED <<consented, sent, via>>
(* the sheet's SEND (createSheet): the player has read the consent text on it; the callsign goes when ticked
   (report.ts body: reporter.name, ctx.game.callsign and the replay's names) *)

(* the server answers (report.ts send). Accepted: "SENT, THANKS · <id>", and a send from the sheet stores the consent.
   A 200 JSON answer whose body the TIMEOUT_MS abort cut off is accepted too (without the id): the server only answers
   that way once the report is stored.
   Refused (a non-OK answer, no connection, or the TIMEOUT_MS abort): the sheet stays open with "Not sent: <why>", and
   a one-tap send shows a "NOT SENT" toast *)

Refused ==

  /\ screen' = IF RefusedShown THEN "refused" ELSE IF via = "sheet" THEN "sheet" ELSE back
  /\ UNCHANGED <<consented, sent, via, back>>
\* the toast goes away; a refused sheet send leaves the sheet open, where the player can send again or cancel

\* every upload is answered in the end: the server replies, or report.ts send aborts it after TIMEOUT_MS
Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars /\ WF_vars(Accepted \/ Refused)

(* --- the rules --- *)
\* Nothing a player sends by hand leaves the browser before they have seen the consent text on the sheet.
NoManualSendWithoutConsent == \A r \in sent : r.consented
\* The callsign goes only in a send where "Include my callsign" was ticked.
CallsignOnlyWhenTicked == \A r \in sent : r.callsign => r.ticked
\* Every send ends with something on screen: the thank-you with the report id, or a message that it did not go.
EverySendAnswered == [][screen = "sending" => screen' \in {"sent", "refused"}]_vars
\* ... and a send never hangs: the player always sees one of the two in the end.
SendEnds == screen = "sending" ~> screen \in {"sent", "refused"}
