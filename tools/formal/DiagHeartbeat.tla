---------------------------- MODULE DiagHeartbeat ----------------------------
(* KONG-71's crash heartbeat, two tabs of one browser profile (they share localStorage and Web Locks). Design = "locks"
   is the code (client/src/playtest/beat.ts, diag.ts, report.ts; built in #198 and #215 after this model found the bugs of
   the plan; the first beat moved into the boot chunk after #243); Design = "plan" is the design as first written (one shared record, beaten every 5 s, marked clean on
   pagehide), kept for DiagHeartbeat.findings.cfg, where all three rules break.

   Tabs are browser tabs; Sessions is a pool of page lifetimes: a tab that opens takes a fresh one, so "the crash of
   session 1" and "the page now open in tab a" are told apart.

   Not modelled: time (a 5 s beat is a step that may or may not happen before a kill), the 7-day expiry of old records
   (KEEP_MS), browsers without Web Locks (they keep no heartbeat), and the automatic summary, which is not built (slice 2;
   when it is, add it back as the plan had it, git show e1e3509:tools/formal/DiagHeartbeat.tla). *)

VARIABLES
  cur,      \* the session open in each tab, None = no page
  bf,       \* the page is in the back/forward cache (pagehide persisted), not running
  used,     \* sessions already started
  started,  \* locks: sessions whose first beat is written (beat.ts startBeat, in the boot chunk); plan: every opened session
  held,     \* locks: sessions whose page holds its Web Lock (taken by startBeat, released when the page dies)
  checked,  \* locks: sessions whose page looked for dead sessions (the lazy chunk ran findDeadSession)
  dead,     \* sessions that ended by a kill or crash, not by a clean pagehide
  seen,     \* dead sessions a load has picked up
  prompt,   \* the dead session the crash prompt on this tab's title is about, None = no prompt
  reports,  \* crash reports sent about each session
  hb,       \* plan: the one heartbeat record in localStorage
  hbs       \* locks: one heartbeat record per session, "none" | "running" | "clean" (kr.diag.hb.<sid>)

(* --- the rules, in the player's words --- *)
\* The title never says "your last session closed unexpectedly" about a session that is still open, or that ended cleanly.
NoFalseCrash == \A t \in Tabs : prompt[t] # None => prompt[t] \in dead
\* A session that dies after its first beat is picked up by a later load: until then the evidence is still in
\* localStorage. A tab killed before main.ts runs (while the boot JS downloads and parses) leaves no record (see the skill).
NoLostCrash == \A s \in (dead \cap started) \ seen :
  IF Design = "plan" THEN hb.owner = s /\ ~hb.clean ELSE hbs[s] = "running"
\* One crash is reported at most once, however many tabs load and whatever the player taps.
