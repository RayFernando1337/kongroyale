--------------------------- MODULE ClientLifecycle ---------------------------
(* The game client's life from page load to the next match (client/src/main.ts boot, client/src/game/index.ts
   sessions, client/src/game/render.ts GameRender and its "match" resource scope, client/src/engine/res/restore.ts
   context loss), with the server's side reduced to the messages the client gets (server/lobby.ts). One player, one
   tab. Abstracted: the match's phases are one step each; positions, loot and timers are left out; the reload timers
   are a step that can happen while the context is lost.

   Online: CREATE/JOIN, the room, host START. Offline: PLAY vs bots (a practice match on an OfflineLink, or under
   ?hostworker=1 a WorkerLink whose host can die: PracticeHostLost). Left out: an online link that drops mid-match and
   the reconnect card (index.ts linkLost, reconnectTry), which end in the same exitToRoom rewire as MatchOver. *)
EXTENDS Naturals

CONSTANTS Online   \* TRUE: include the online room paths; FALSE: practice only (a smaller chart)

VARIABLES
  boot,      \* "loading" | "ready" (window.__kr.ready)
  prefabs,   \* kits.viewModel exists (built after ready by kr.prefabWarmP, index.ts:88,817)
  view,      \* what the player sees: "title" | "room" | "match" | "results"
  phase,     \* the match phase the client shows: "warmup" | "plane" | "play" | "results"
  link,      \* "none" | "offline" | "online"
  scope,     \* live "match" resource scopes (resources.root.child("match"), render.ts:163): 0 or 1
  render,    \* a GameRender is wired (render !== null in index.ts)
  seated,    \* online: the server still has this client in the running match
  err,       \* an error text is on screen (lobbyState.error)
  why,       \* the server ended this client's match with a reason the player has not seen dismissed yet
  silent,    \* the player pressed a button and nothing happened (no busy state, no error, no screen)
  ctx,       \* WebGL: "ok" | "lost" | "restoring"
  restores   \* restoreAll() runs in flight (restore-run.ts:13-20)

(* wire(l) (index.ts:269-284): dispose the old GameRender, then new GameRender: its field initializer opens the
   "match" scope (throws if one is still live, scope.ts:130), then its constructor needs kits.viewModel (render.ts:233) *)
WireScope == IF render THEN 0 ELSE scope            \* after render?.dispose()
WireOk == WireScope = 0 /\ prefabs
WireScopeAfter == IF WireScope = 0 THEN 1 ELSE WireScope

(* PLAY vs bots: offline() (index.ts:251-266): leaveAll, new OfflineLink, wire, start in 50 ms. A PLAY pressed before
   ready (Enter, a controller, a focused button) waits in prepareIsland for dataset.ready, so it is a PLAY after ready *)
Play ==
  /\ view = "title"   \* a lost context does not disable the title's buttons (restore.ts watchContext)
  /\ prefabs   \* after ready, kr.prepare() waits for the prefabs (main.ts:502-531)

(* CREATE/JOIN: online() (index.ts:240-256) reuses the online link it has (241) unless a multi-process server's front
   put it on another process than the room's (KR_PROCS, net.ts roomUrl): then it silences and closes that link and
   connects again, the same wire as a first connect. One that closed at the title is already gone
   (SocketClosesAtTitle). Like PLAY,
   create and join await prepareIsland(), which waits for the prefabs after ready and resolves at once before it;
   before ready they wait there for dataset.ready, invite links included *)
Connect ==
  /\ Online /\ view = "title"
  /\ prefabs
  \* wire() runs inside online()'s try: when GameRender throws, the catch drops the link (the socket stays open,
  \* unreferenced) and shows "NO SERVER", a visible but wrong reason

  /\ view' = (IF WireOk THEN "room" ELSE "title") /\ silent' = FALSE /\ err' = ~WireOk

  /\ scope' = WireScopeAfter /\ render' = WireOk
  /\ UNCHANGED <<boot, prefabs, view, phase, seated, why, silent, ctx, restores>>
\* the socket closes at the title (server idle close, network drop): wire()'s onClose drops the link there, so the next
\* CREATE / JOIN connects again (in a match or a room it runs linkLost instead, which the model leaves out)

\* The match's resource scope is open only while a match view (GameRender) owns it, so the next PLAY can open its own.
ScopeHasOwner == scope = 1 => render
\* Pressing PLAY, CREATE or JOIN always does something the player can see.

\* A match on screen is one the server still plays for this player (offline matches always are).
NoFrozenMatch == view \in {"match", "results"} /\ link = "online" => seated
\* When the server ends the player's match with a reason, the reason stays on screen until the player moves on.

\* One context restore at a time.

\* A match on screen always has its renderer.
NoMatchWithoutRenderer == view \in {"match", "results"} => render
\* Once you are back on the title, the server no longer holds a seat in a match for you.
