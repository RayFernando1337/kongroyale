--------------------------- MODULE PoiResidency ---------------------------
(* Low-memory POI streaming on the client (client/src/low-mem.ts, client/src/main.ts stream()): which streamed
   locations hold memory, and when one is evicted. On by default in Safari and on devices reporting under 8 GB
   (low-mem-device.ts); this is what keeps a 16 GB Mac's Safari tab alive. Desktop Chrome builds every POI once and
   keeps it (no eviction), so it is not modelled.

   Abstracted: distances are four classes per POI, in the order the code ranks them (low-mem.ts distM): the camera
   is inside it; it is "ahead", where the glide lands (only while the player falls or glides, RAY-272); near enough to
   build; far. The camera moves arbitrarily between ticks, and memory cost is a count (lowmemcap) rather than MB (lowmembudget,
   whose estimate starts at 400 MB a POI). Evicted is "queued again" (low-mem.ts:257). *)
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

CONSTANTS Pois, Cap,
  MaxInside   \* how many POI circles the camera can stand in at once: 1, or 2 where two circles overlap on the map

VARIABLES
  st,       \* per POI: queued | trimming (picked, eviction pass running) | building | integrating | live
  dist,     \* per POI: "inside" (camera inside it: d <= 0) | "ahead" (the glide lands on it) | "near" | "far"
  glide,    \* the local player is falling or gliding (low-mem.ts descending(): cm.pred.st Freefall or Glide)
  inMatch,  \* kr.game.inMatch (nextNearModule picks only in a match)
  loop,     \* the stream loop: "pick" (nextNearModule) | "trim" | "build" | "wait" (inflight back-pressure)
  thrown,   \* (for the rules) a POI was evicted while still building or fading in
  outside,  \* (for the rules) a POI was picked to build outside a match
  late,     \* (for the rules) a build started outside a match (picked in one, left before its trim finished)
  skipped,  \* (for the rules) a pick took a POI behind or to the side while one the glide lands on was queued
  dropped   \* (for the rules) the POI the glide lands on was evicted while one behind or to the side stayed
