--------------------------- MODULE PoiResidency ---------------------------
(* Low-memory POI streaming on the client (client/src/low-mem.ts, client/src/main.ts stream()): which streamed
   locations hold memory, and when one is evicted. On by default in Safari and on devices reporting under 8 GB
   (low-mem-device.ts); this is what keeps a 16 GB Mac's Safari tab alive. Desktop Chrome builds every POI once and
   keeps it (no eviction), so it is not modelled.

   Abstracted: distances are three classes per POI (the camera is inside it, near enough to build, far),
   the camera moves arbitrarily between ticks, and memory cost is a count (lowmemcap) rather than MB (lowmembudget,
   whose estimate starts at 400 MB a POI). Evicted is "queued again" (low-mem.ts:257). *)
EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

CONSTANTS Pois, Cap,
  MaxInside   \* how many POI circles the camera can stand in at once: 1, or 2 where two circles overlap on the map

VARIABLES
  st,       \* per POI: queued | trimming (picked, eviction pass running) | building | integrating | live
  dist,     \* per POI: "inside" (camera inside it: d <= 0) | "near" | "far"
  inMatch,  \* kr.game.inMatch (nextNearModule picks only in a match)
  loop,     \* the stream loop: "pick" (nextNearModule) | "trim" | "build" | "wait" (inflight back-pressure)
  thrown,   \* (for the rules) a POI was evicted while still building or fading in
  outside,  \* (for the rules) a POI was picked to build outside a match
  late      \* (for the rules) a build started outside a match (picked in one, left before its trim finished)

Held == {p \in Pois : st[p] \in {"building", "integrating", "live"}}   \* hold GPU/CPU memory
\* what residents() counts (low-mem.ts trimStreamed): POIs in modOf that are live or still in building; a POI inside
\* its own build() is not in modOf yet (main.ts buildOne sets it when build() returns), so it does not count
Counted == {p \in Pois : st[p] \in {"integrating", "live"}}
\* evictionsFor (low-mem.ts:165-169): only live POIs (integrating ones are -Infinity) the camera is not inside

(* the camera moves: any POI's distance class changes. A POI the camera stands in is never evicted (evictionsFor keeps
   d <= 0), and some POI circles overlap, so MaxInside = 2 lets the camera stand in two at once *)

(* nextNearModule: in a match, a queued POI near the camera; the admission test (low-mem.ts:63-65) skips one that,
   counted lowmemhyst farther, would itself be evicted: in this abstraction, one that is not nearer than an evictable
   resident while the list is full *)
