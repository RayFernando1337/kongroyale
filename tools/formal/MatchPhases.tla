---------------------------- MODULE MatchPhases ----------------------------
(* Match phases: Warmup, Plane, Play, Results, then the match is over (a lobby match) or warms up again (practice).
   A model of Match.step's phase logic (shared/sim/match.ts) and the warm-up hold the host wires
   (MatchHost.holdForStream, shared/net/host.ts). Checked with TLC by tools/formal/tlc.mjs; the verify-match-phases
   skill says how to run and read it, and draws it with the pstack statechart skill.

   Time is counted in steps of the match clock. Constants stand for the real ones at a smaller scale:
     W = WARMUP_S (25 s), Lead = the 3 s before the plane where the hold parks the clock, Cap = holdForStream's maxS
     (40 s, longer than the warm-up as in the code), PlaneLen = PLANE_OPEN_S + PLANE_BAY_S + 1, R = RESULTS_S.
   Squads are abstract: "alive" (a kong of it is alive), "waiting" (all down, a redeploy pending), "out" (eliminated).
   squadsLeft counts every squad in the warm-up, and the alive or waiting ones after it (Match.squadsLeft).
   The storm is three steps: 0 = phases with resurgence, 1 = phases without (PHASE_REF res: false from phase 5),
   2 = the last circle, radius 0, where nobody survives for long (storm.ts stormAt: done, dps 20).
   Left out: positions, health, loot, the economy (its buy-back revives a kong only while a squadmate is alive, so it
   never brings an eliminated squad back), solo redeploy limits (they only make the end come sooner), and the
   'time > 5' in checkEnd (the plane alone takes longer than that). *)

CONSTANTS Squads, W, Lead, Cap, PlaneLen, R,
          EndAfterResults,   \* TRUE for a lobby match (server/index.ts Lobby.start), FALSE for practice
          Trios              \* TRUE: a squad wipe is final at once (Match.kill: no redeploy without a living squadmate)

VARIABLES phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res, sq
vars == <<phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res, sq>>

Live == phase \in {"plane", "play"}   \* the match clock runs: the storm moves, kongs die and redeploy
SquadsLeft == IF phase = "warmup" THEN Cardinality(Squads) ELSE Cardinality({q \in Squads : sq[q] # "out"})

\* enterWarmup (Lobby.start makes the Match, whose constructor calls it)
Init ==
  /\ phase = "warmup" /\ over = FALSE /\ t = 0 /\ wall = 0 /\ held = 0 /\ skip = FALSE
  /\ streaming \in BOOLEAN /\ storm = 0 /\ res = TRUE /\ sq = [q \in Squads |-> "alive"]

Fresh == storm' = 0 /\ res' = TRUE /\ sq' = [q \in Squads |-> "alive"]

\* ---- Match.step in the warm-up: the clocks move, then the hold, else the plane
HoldOn == held < Cap /\ streaming   \* holdForStream: warmHeldS < maxS and a seated peer still streaming
WarmTick ==
  /\ phase = "warmup" /\ ~over
  /\ LET pt == t + 1 IN LET ww == wall + 1 IN
     IF (pt >= W - Lead \/ skip) /\ ww < W /\ HoldOn
     THEN /\ held' = held + 1 /\ t' = (IF pt > W - Lead THEN W - Lead ELSE pt) /\ wall' = ww

     ELSE /\ t' = pt /\ wall' = ww /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, held, skip>>
  /\ UNCHANGED <<over, streaming, storm, res, sq>>

\* the owner's START during a running match: Match.startNow (warm-up only)
StartNow == phase = "warmup" /\ ~skip /\ skip' = TRUE /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, t, wall, held, streaming, storm, res, sq>>

\* a client reports its island stream (onJSON "stream"), or a late joiner arrives still streaming
Stream == phase = "warmup" /\ streaming' = ~streaming /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, storm, res, sq>>

\* stepPlane: the plane flies; the bay closes and enterPlay
PlaneTick ==
  /\ phase = "plane"
  /\ IF t + 1 >= PlaneLen THEN phase' = "play" /\ t' = 0 ELSE (t' = t + 1 /\ UNCHANGED phase)
  /\ UNCHANGED <<over, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res, sq>>

\* stormAt: the storm runs on the match clock (its first circle closes long after the plane: PHASE_REF waits 80 s)
Storm == phase = "play" /\ storm < 2 /\ storm' = storm + 1 /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, res, sq>>

\* resurgence ends: the storm phase says so (or few squads are left; that only makes it sooner). Everyone waiting is out.
ResOff ==
  /\ Live /\ res /\ storm >= 1 /\ res' = FALSE
  /\ sq' = [q \in Squads |-> IF sq[q] = "waiting" THEN "out" ELSE sq[q]]
  /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm>>

\* Match.kill of a squad's last living kong: it waits to redeploy only while resurgence is on (and, in trios, never)
Wipe(q) ==
  /\ Live /\ sq[q] = "alive"
  /\ sq' = [sq EXCEPT ![q] = IF res /\ ~Trios THEN "waiting" ELSE "out"]
  /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res>>

\* stepRespawns: a waiting kong redeploys
Redeploy(q) == Live /\ res /\ sq[q] = "waiting" /\ sq' = [sq EXCEPT ![q] = "alive"] /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res>>

\* checkEnd: one squad (or none) left in Play: enterResults
End == phase = "play" /\ SquadsLeft <= 1 /\ phase' = "results" /\ t' = 0 /\ UNCHANGED <<over, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res, sq>>

\* the results screen, then over (Lobby.pump sees m.over and calls endMatch) or a new warm-up (practice)
ResultsTick ==
  /\ phase = "results" /\ ~over
  /\ IF t + 1 > R
     THEN IF EndAfterResults
          THEN (over' = TRUE /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, t, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res, sq>>)

     ELSE (t' = t + 1 /\ UNCHANGED <<phase, over, wall, held, skip, streaming, storm, res, sq>>)

\* the match is over and the lobby is back in its room: nothing moves any more
Done == over /\ UNCHANGED vars

Next ==
  \/ WarmTick \/ StartNow \/ Stream \/ PlaneTick \/ Storm \/ ResOff \/ End \/ ResultsTick \/ Done
  \/ \E q \in Squads : Wipe(q) \/ Redeploy(q)

\* The clocks always move; the storm's last circle wipes every squad still in it (strong fairness: it may be dodged for a
\* while, never forever); checkEnd runs every step.
Fairness ==
  /\ WF_vars(WarmTick) /\ WF_vars(PlaneTick) /\ WF_vars(ResultsTick) /\ WF_vars(Storm) /\ WF_vars(ResOff) /\ WF_vars(End)
  /\ \A q \in Squads : SF_vars(storm = 2 /\ phase = "play" /\ Wipe(q))

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars /\ Fairness

\* ---- the rules

\* the only phase changes are Warmup -> Plane -> Play -> Results, and Results -> Warmup in practice
Edges == {<<"warmup", "plane">>, <<"plane", "play">>, <<"play", "results">>, <<"results", "warmup">>}
PhaseOrder == [][phase' # phase => <<phase, phase'>> \in Edges]_vars

\* the warm-up never lasts longer than a full warm-up, however long a client streams (Match.warmWall)
WarmupBounded == phase = "warmup" => wall <= W

\* the results screen has one winning squad, or none (all wiped at once)
OneWinner == phase = "results" => SquadsLeft <= 1

\* a match is over only from its results screen
OverFromResults == over => phase = "results"

\* a started lobby match ends: its loop stops and the players are back in the room (practice loops by design)
MatchEnds == EndAfterResults => <>over

\* every Play reaches its results (practice included)
PlayEnds == phase = "play" ~> phase = "results"
