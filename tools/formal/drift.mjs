// npm test's `formal` check: fails when code a TLA+ model in tools/formal/ describes has changed since the model last
// passed TLC, so a model can't keep passing while it describes code that no longer exists. No Java needed: it compares
// token hashes of the regions each <Model>.covers.json names against the ones tlc.mjs --record wrote (tools/formal/
// covers.mjs), and checks that no code outside those regions writes the state the model guards.
//   node tools/formal/drift.mjs              every model with a covers file
//   node tools/formal/drift.mjs MatchPhases  one model
