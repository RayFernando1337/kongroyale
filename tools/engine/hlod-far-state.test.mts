// HLOD far state (client/src/engine/hlod.ts) for a POI whose module swaps its own near model and far proxy (RAY-248).
// The plantation registers its near model, its far proxy, a glow drawn only up close and, through the boot's
// attribution, veg splat LOD rings. Some of them are hidden at every distance, so a capture that waited for every root
// to be visible never ran: the POI stayed in "wait" with no proxy for the whole match. The far state is what the module
// draws at that distance; only a root hidden by an engine gate (terrain occlusion, the build gate) means "not yet".
